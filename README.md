The mai objective for this game is to get your character from the bottom of the playing board to the water, which is located on the top.

To do this, you must avoid the enemies on the screen.

You start with 5 lives. Everytime you are hit by an enemy, one life will be taken from you. 

The game finishes when all your lives are depleted.

Everytime you reach the water, you gain 100 points.

The game will get harder as you score more points (more enemies will try to stop you).
